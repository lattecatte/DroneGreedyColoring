Multicopter collision simulation using the Greedy Coloring algorithm.

# Introduction
The objective of an unmanned traffic management (UTM) is to optimize the capacity of the high-density low-level 
uncontrolled airspace. One such method for optimization is to assign different vertical layers of altitude for 
unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) flight operations that are in conflict.
This study aims to analyze the deconfliction of unmanned aircraft traffic management at the high-density low-level 
uncontrolled airspace by utilizing the vertical layer assignment method. This was done by modeling the airspace 
and generating random UAS flight operations and applying the greedy coloring algorithm to resolve conflicts 
between operations. We compare the cases for the single UTM architecture where operations are managed by one 
with one UTM service provider (UTMSP), to the federated UTM architecture where operations are split among 
multiple UTMSPs based on flight headings.
